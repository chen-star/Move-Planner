# Move Planner
Hello, this is a project based on **JavaScript**.

By using **AJAX** of **jQuery**, we can build this Web application to help people know about the destination they will move to.

## What is AJAX
**AJAX** means **S**ynchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML.

By using **AJAX**, you can:

* Update a web page without reloading the page

* Request data from a server after the page has loaded

* Receive data from a server after the page has loaded

* Send data to a server in the background

**AJAX** allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to updata parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

## Functions of Move planner

This is a web page application. On this web page, by inputting the address that you want to visit, you can see:

* A map mark identifies the location you input
* Some commets about this location on New York Times
* Some links about this location on WikiPedia

Here, I use three APIs to implement: Google Street Viewer API, NYTimes API and WikiPedia API. Since many errors could happen on the Internet, I also add some functions to handle these errors. 

Here are two screenshots of this application.
